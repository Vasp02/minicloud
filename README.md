# Minicloud

Minicloud is a full-stack cloud application designed for secure file storage. It allows users to create accounts that have implemented storage limits and manage their root file system, including the ability to create and delete files or folders as needed. Utilizing AES encryption, Minicloud ensures that all stored files are securely encrypted and are only decrypted dynamically when access is required.

## Features : 

- User account based system with storage limit implementation
- Intuitive management and organization of the file directory system, including capabilities to view and download files.
- Administrator page accessible via admin account, allowing for the adjustment of user storage configurations.
- Security implementations like AES file encryption and dynamic decryption for files, JWT Token for authentication.
- Utilizes JpaRepository, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate for flexible data management, enabling database customization without modifications
